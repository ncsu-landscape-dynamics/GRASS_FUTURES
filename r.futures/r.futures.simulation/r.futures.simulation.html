<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Module <em>r.futures.simulation</em> is part of <a href="r.futures.html">FUTURES</a>
land change model.
This module uses stochastic Patch-Growing Algorithm (PGA)
and a combination of field-based and object-based representations
to simulate land changes.

PGA simulates undeveloped to developed land change by iterative site selection
and a contextually aware region growing mechanism.
Simulations of change at each time step feed development pressure back
to the POTENTIAL submodel, influencing site suitability for the next step.

<h3>Patch growing</h3>
Patches are constructed in
three steps. First, a potential seed is randomly selected from available cells.
In case <b>seed_search</b> is <em>probability</em>, the probability value (based on POTENTIAL)
of the seed is tested using Monte Carlo approach, and if it doesn't survive,
new potential seed is selected and tested.
Second, using a 4- or 8-neighbor (see <b>num_neighbors</b>) search rule PGA grows the patch.
PGA decides on the suitability of contiguous cells based on their
underlying development potential and distance to the seed adjusted
by compactness parameter given in <b>compactness_mean</b> and <b>compactness_range</b>.
The size of the patch is determined by randomly selecting a patch size from <b>patch sizes</b> file
and multiplied by <b>discount_factor</b>. To find optimal values
for patch sizes and compactness, use module
<em><a href="r.futures.calib.html">r.futures.calib</a></em>.
Once a cell is converted, it remains developed.
PGA continues to grow patches until the per capita land demand is satisfied.

<h3>Development pressure</h3>
Development pressure is a dynamic spatial variable
derived from the patch-building process of PGA and associated with the POTENTIAL submodel.
At each time step, PGA updates the POTENTIAL probability surface based on land change,
and the new development pressure then affects future land change.
The initial development pressure is computed using module
<em><a href="r.futures.devpressure.html">r.futures.devpressure</a></em>.
The same input parameters of this module
(<b>gamma</b>, <b>scaling factor</b> and <b>n_dev_neighbourhood</b>)
are then used as input for
<em><a href="r.futures.simulation.html">r.futures.simulation</a></em>.

<h3>Scenarios</h3>
Scenarios involving policies that encourage infill versus sprawl
can be explored using the <b>incentive_power</b> parameter,
which uses a power function to transform the probability in POTENTIAL.

<p>
Additionally, parameter <b>potential_weight</b> (raster map from -1 to 1)
enables to include policies (such as new regulations or fees) which limit  or encourage
development in certain areas.
Where <b>potential_weight</b> values are lower than 0,
the probability surface is simply multiplied by the values,
which results in decreased site suitability.
Similarly, values greater than 0 result in increased site suitability.
The probability surface is transformed from initial probability <em>p</em>
with value <em>w</em> to p + w - p * w.

<h3>Output</h3>
After the simulation ends, raster specified in parameter <b>output</b> is written.
If optional parameter <b>output_series</b> is specified, additional output
is a series of raster maps for each step.
Cells with value 0 represents the initial development, values >= 1 then represent
the step in which the cell was developed. Undeveloped cells have value -1.

<h3>Climate forcing</h3>
Climate forcing submodel estimates the probability that a developed pixel will experience flood damage
and the likely adaptation response (protect and armour, retreat, or stay trapped).
Response is based on flood probability, level of damage, and local estimates of adaptive capacity.
Climate forcing submodel integrates current and future flood probability and flood depth data
with the adaptive capacity of developed pixels to probabilistically predict flood severity
and the response evoked by flooding in a developed pixel. The model also predicts the within- or
between-county destinations of displaced residents. 

<p>
The input <b>flood_maps_file</b> includes flood depth data for different flood probabilities
for different steps of the simulation:
<pre>
step,probability,raster
1,0.05,flood_20yr_2020_depth
1,0.01,flood_100yr_2020_depth
1,0.002,flood_500yr_2020_depth
11,0.05,flood_20yr_2030_depth
11,0.01,flood_100yr_2030_depth
11,0.002,flood_500yr_2030_depth
</pre>

Alternatively, if such detailed data are not available, one can use floodplain raster
of given flood return period together with HAND (Height Above Nearest Drainage) raster 
(<b>hand</b> option) derived from a DEM
to estimate flood depth automatically (experimental). Flood probablity raster
then contains the probability values (e.g., 0.01 for a 100-yr flood).
<pre>
  step,raster
  1,flood_probability_2020
  11,flood_probability_2030
</pre>
Option <b>hand_percentile</b> influences the derived depth, high values (> 90)
tend to overestimate the flood depth.

<p>Flood events are stochastically simulated on the level of HUCs (e.g., HUC 12),
use <b>huc</b> input option for raster representation of HUCs.
Use <b>flood_logfile</b> to log the simulated flood events into a CSV file
for further information (step, HUC ID, flood probability).

<p>Once a flood event is simulated, local damage is estimated
  using flood-damage curves provided in a CSV file in option <b>depth_damage_functions</b>.
Its header includes inundation levels in vertical units.
The first column is an id of a subregion given in <b>ddf_subregions</b>
and the values are percentages of structural damage.
<pre>
ID,0.3,0.6,0.9
101,0,15,20
102,10,20,30
</pre>

Once the damage is established, response is stochastically evaluated based
on the <b>adaptive_capacity</b> raster with values ranging from -1 (most vulnerable)
to 1 (most resilient). Option <b>response_func</b> evaluates the response
based on the damage and adaptive capacity, e.g., with high damage vulnerable populations are
less likely to protect and armour (adapt) than higly resilient populations.
Responses include 1) retreat resulting in pixel abandonment,
2) stay and adapt, and 3) stay trapped.
When a pixel is abandoned, the <b>redistribution_matrix</b>
is used to decide to which subregion the pixel is moved.
It contains probabilities of moving from one subregion to another:
<pre>
ID,37013,37014,...
37013,0.6,0.01,...
37014,0.05,0.3,...
</pre>
Output file <b>redistribution_output</b> can be used to log the redistribution
happening during the simulation.
